# Log Crisis

```
In the midst of academic chaos, Q found himself in a dire situation. He's about to face his FODS viva, but he hasn't completed a critical grid search. His logs are a mess and he's got a crucial course on the line! Read the code snippet relevant to the Grid Search and identify the errors. Recover the correct logs and find the flag! There is a secret message hidden in the 'text' field of the logs corresponding to the degree having the lowest error! Two characters taken at once of this message and converted from hex reveal a surprise! The flag is in the format cruXipher{<flag>}
