# Move It!
The downloaded zip file had many folders and we browse through it. We find a file
named 'level1' in "Astronaut Game_Data" folder. We browse through the file to find
any relevant information. We then find two entries in file starting with
"cruXipher" . On entering the found flags, one is found to be a false flag and the
other one being the required flag.
