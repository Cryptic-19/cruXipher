Yo, player! Welcome to the streets of San Andreas. You've stumbled upon a mysterious audio file, and it's not just any tune; it's the GTA San Andreas theme song. But this jam ain't just for your ears; it's packin' a secret message. When you've cracked the code, it'll lead you to the treasure buried deep in these streets. Make sure to replace whitespaces in your answer with underscores. The flag is in the format cruXipher{<flag>}
