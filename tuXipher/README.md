- On opening the [portfolio](./portfolio.html) we are greeted with a skilz list which contains a hyperlink to the projects website.
- On the projects website we find a mysterious tux project which contains this string "WTNKMVdHbHdhR1Z5ZTAxNU5UY3pjakV3ZFRWZk4zVjRYelV3Ym1kZlJETmpNRFJrTTJSOQ=="
- Running it through CyberChef shows it's a doubly base64 encoded string and gives the flag.
